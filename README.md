# java-class-practice

A collection of Java assignments I completed in my **Program Design and Abstraction** course.

This repository includes small projects and exercises focused on strengthening core Java concepts, such as:

- Working with lists and collections
- Inheritance and class hierarchies
- Object-oriented programming principles like polymorphism and abstraction
